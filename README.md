# Nesto Test Automation Project

## Overview

This is an end-to-end test automation project for Nesto using Playwright and TypeScript. The project includes comprehensive test suites for login, signup, and consent functionalities with multi-language support (English and French), parallel test execution, and detailed reporting.

## Features

- ✅ **Multi-language testing** (English & French)
- ✅ **Page Object Model** architecture
- ✅ **Parallel test execution**
- ✅ **Automated code quality checks** (ESLint & Prettier)
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** for code quality enforcement
- ✅ **Comprehensive test reporting** (HTML & Allure)
- ✅ **CI/CD integration** with GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Type-safe** with TypeScript

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: LTS version (v18 or higher recommended)
- **npm**: v10 or higher
- **Git**: For version control

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marisouza/nesto-assessment
   cd nesto-assessment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers** (if not automatically installed)

   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

_Note: This step may not be necessary if browsers were installed during `npm ci`. Run this if you encounter browser-related errors._

## Running Tests

### Language Support

Tests support both English and French. Set the language using the `LANGUAGE` environment variable:

```bash
# Run tests in French
LANGUAGE=fr npm run test:headed

# Run tests in English (default)
npm run test:headed
```

### Interactive Mode (UI)

Run all tests with Playwright UI:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### Headed Mode

Run all tests in headed mode (browser visible):

```bash
npm run test:headed
```

### Test Suites by Tag

Run specific test suites using tags:

```bash
npm run test:consent      # Consent tests (@consent tag)
npm run test:login        # Login tests (@login tag)
npm run test:signup       # Signup tests (@signup tag)
```

### Additional Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (headless)
npx playwright test

# Run tests with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# Run a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Test Reports

### HTML Report

View Playwright HTML report:

```bash
npm run report:show
```

### Allure Report

Generate and view Allure report:

```bash
npm run report:allure
```

Reports are generated in:

- `playwright-report/` - HTML reports
- `allure-results/` - Allure test results
- `allure-report/` - Generated Allure reports

CI Reports available at [github-pages](https://github.com/marisouza/nesto-assessment/deployments/github-pages)

## Code Quality

The project enforces code quality through ESLint and Prettier with automated pre-commit hooks.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Git hooks are managed by **Husky** and **lint-staged**:

- **Automatic linting**: ESLint runs with `--fix` on staged `.ts` and `.js` files
- **Automatic formatting**: Prettier formats staged files before commit
- **Type checking**: TypeScript compilation checks ensure type safety

The pre-commit hook runs automatically when you commit. To bypass (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

### Manual Code Quality Checks

#### Linting

Check for linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint              # Run ESLint and TypeScript type checking
npm run lint:ci           # Run TypeScript type checking only (CI mode)
```

#### Code Formatting

Check and fix code formatting:

```bash
npm run format:check      # Check if files are formatted
npm run format:fix        # Auto-fix formatting issues
```

### Supported File Types

- **Linting**: `.ts`, `.js` files
- **Formatting**: `.ts`, `.js`, `.json`, `.md` files

## Configuration

### Playwright Configuration

Test configuration is managed in [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts):

- **Test directory**: `./tests`
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 1 (CI), 0 (local)
- **Workers**: 4 (parallel execution)
- **Base URL**: Configured for test environment
- **Screenshots**: On failure
- **Trace**: On first retry
- **Reporters**: HTML and Allure

### Environment Variables

The project supports the following environment variables:

- **`LANGUAGE`**: Set test language (`en` or `fr`, default: `en`)
- **`CI`**: Indicates CI environment (automatically set by GitHub Actions)

Example:

```bash
LANGUAGE=fr npx playwright test
```

### Locales Configuration

Multi-language support is managed through locale files in the [`locales/`](locales/) directory. Each page has its own locale file with translations for both English and French.

### Project-Specific Settings

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Workflows are defined in [.github/workflows/docker-playwright.yml](.github/workflows/docker-playwright.yml).
